Our project features a comprehensive set of widgets integrated into a browser extension to enhance organizational communication and productivity. We developed 13 widgets, including Weather, Google Slide Integration, Google Spreadsheet, Google Form, Google Meet, ChatGPT, Google Calendar, Pomodoro Timer, Announcements, Steps/Health Tracker, Opportunity Board, Generic Leaderboard, and TIL Corner. Each widget addresses specific needs with robust error handling and user interaction considerations. Our design draws from contemporary UI principles, ensuring both functionality and aesthetic appeal. For a detailed look at our project, please refer to the attached screenshot and Loom video.
